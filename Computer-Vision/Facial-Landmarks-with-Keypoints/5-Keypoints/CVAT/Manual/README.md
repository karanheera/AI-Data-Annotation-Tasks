Here’s a complete **`README.md`** for your **Facial-Landmarks 5-Keypoints Annotation** project, following the same style as your previous projects:

# Facial Landmarks (5-Keypoints) Annotation

![Example Keypoints](before_after.gif)

This project demonstrates **manual facial landmarks annotation** using **5 keypoints per face** in **CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)**.

The annotations are exported in **CVAT XML format**, where each keypoint is stored with precise **x, y coordinates**.
A Python notebook analyzes the exported dataset and produces:

* Dataset statistics
* Keypoint validation
* Distribution plots
* A GitHub-ready Markdown report

This project focuses entirely on **annotation accuracy**, **keypoint consistency**, and **dataset-level insights**.
No model training is included.

## About the GIF (Example Keypoints)

The preview demonstrates:

* Annotated facial keypoints over the original image
* 5 keypoints per face:

  * Right eye
  * Left eye
  * Nose tip
  * Mouth right corner
  * Mouth left corner

It represents the annotation style and consistency followed throughout the dataset.

## Dataset Annotation Details

All annotations were created manually in CVAT using **5-point facial landmark labeling**.
The final export is a **CVAT XML** file containing:

* Image metadata
* Keypoints with coordinates
* Label definitions (5 keypoints per face)

The dataset includes **5 annotated images**, fully covering all keypoints per face.

The annotation file is located at:

```
annotations/annotations.xml
```

## Annotation Guidelines

The full annotation rules used for facial landmark creation are documented in:

```
data/GUIDELINES.md
```

This includes:

* Placement rules for each keypoint
* Occlusion handling
* Consistency across multiple faces
* Guidelines for difficult poses or partial visibility
