# Body-Landmarks with Skeleton Keypoints

![Example Keypoints](before_after.gif)

This project demonstrates **manual body landmarks annotation** using **17 keypoints per person** in **CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)**. The annotations are exported in **COCO JSON format**, where each keypoint is stored with precise **x, y coordinates**. A Python notebook analyzes the exported dataset and produces:

* Dataset statistics
* Keypoint validation
* Distribution plots
* A GitHub-ready Markdown report

This project focuses entirely on **annotation accuracy**, **keypoint consistency**, and **dataset-level insights**. **No model training** is included.

## About the GIF (Before vs After Annotation)

The **before-after.gif** demonstrates the annotation process for body landmarks, where:

* The **before** image shows the original, unannotated image.
* The **after** image overlays the **17 body keypoints** on the image, highlighting the **skeleton structure**.

This visual helps to understand the **keypoint annotation style** and **skeleton consistency** across the dataset.

## Dataset Annotation Details

The **Body-Landmarks with Skeleton Keypoints** dataset contains **17 keypoints per body**, annotated manually using **CVAT**. The annotations are exported in **COCO JSON format**, and each annotation includes:

* Image metadata
* 17 keypoints with **x, y coordinates** for each body part
* Label definitions (body landmarks for each person)

The dataset includes **12 annotated images**, fully covering all keypoints per person.

### Example of COCO JSON Format

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "file_name": "pexels-adenir-32996801.jpg",
      "height": 1000,
      "width": 1500,
      "id": 1
    }
  ],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "image_id": 1,
      "category_id": 1,
      "keypoints": [x1, y1, v1, x2, y2, v2, ..., x17, y17, v17],
      "num_keypoints": 17
    }
  ]
}
```

## Annotation Guidelines

The full annotation guidelines used for body landmark creation are documented in:

```
data/GUIDELINES.md
```

This document includes:

* Keypoint placement rules for each body part
* Handling of occlusions and partial visibility
* Consistency across multiple people
* Handling difficult poses or angles

## About the Project

This project demonstrates:

* Manual annotation of **17 body keypoints** per person using **CVAT**.
* Exporting the annotations in **COCO JSON format**.
* Running Python-based analysis for **data validation** and **statistical insights**.
* Consistent **skeleton structure annotation**.

The project does **not** involve model training. The focus is entirely on the **accuracy** and **quality** of annotations and the **statistical analysis** of the dataset.
