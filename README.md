# AI Data Annotation Tasks

Hi! I'm **Karan Heera**, and this repository showcases my experience with **AI Data Annotation and Content Moderation** across multiple domains including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio/Speech Processing, Time Series, Videos, and Conversational AI.  


**Note:** This repository is **constantly being updated**. Currently, I am focusing on **Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks**, and other categories will be added progressively.
